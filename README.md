Filter transmission functions, field grids, etc.

Vendor-measured on-axis filter transmission functions are in `filter_transmission`.

The ZTF field grid is in `field_grid`.

Theoretical and vendor measurements of CCD quantum efficiency are in `QE`.  Note that ZTF's CCDs have two types of AR coating: the northernmost and southernmost eight CCDs have a single-layer coating, while the inner eight have a multi-layer coating.
